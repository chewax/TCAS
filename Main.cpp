// Your mission should you choose to accept is to build an early collission detection system
// TASK: Build a collission detection system to be used by ATC controllers
// Build a solution that receives a CSV containg all aircraft in a given radious and return all that are prone to collide
// ITERATION 1: Use path intersection and vertical separation
// ITERATION 2: Take into account speed factor.
//
// CAVEATS: 
// 1. Given the relative small size of the radious considered, the earth is considered a plane and not corrected.
